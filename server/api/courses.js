// When we save the date+time, we create a new Event.
// When we choose 4 restaurants, put request to the event by ID.
// When we invite users to that event, we bind them to that event
// * create a put request to the event (specified by ID) & set the users to the invites we sent
// * using magic methods to set/add each user to the event.
// When it's time for them to choose their courses, we have a form that autopopulates the restaurant, users,
// courses in drop downs & allows the user to choose their course type & restaruant & type in their course
//this information will be a post request to courses, and then we will have to set the course
// to the respective event in the route.
